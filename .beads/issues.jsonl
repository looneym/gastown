Add Start() error handling to BdActivitySource\n\n**File**: internal/tui/feed/events.go\n\nAdd timeout check - if no output in 5s, assume hung and kill subprocess.\nReturn error from Start() if subprocess fails to launch.\n\n### 2. Make source addition conditional\n\n**File**: internal/cmd/feed.go (runFeed function)\n\nTry each source, log warning if fails, only add to sources array if succeeds.\nError out only if NO sources available.\n\n### 3. Fix plain mode\n\n**File**: internal/cmd/feed.go (plain mode path)\n\nRemove --follow flag from bd activity call in plain mode.\nLet it exit after showing events (one-shot query).\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Feed never hangs - continues with available sources\n- Plain mode works for Boot triage (exits cleanly)\n- Clear error messages when sources fail\n- TUI shows what's available even if bd broken\n\n## Testing\n\nTest plain mode exits cleanly, TUI mode handles bd unavailable, normal operation works.\n\nSee town bead hq-u50v for complete implementation details.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"gastown/polecats/nux","created_at":"2026-01-09T08:53:16.104759Z","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-09T09:31:29.370421Z","closed_at":"2026-01-09T09:31:29.370421Z","close_reason":"Implementation complete and verified.
