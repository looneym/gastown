# Polecat workflow demonstration - valkyrie (gt-wisp-7qi)

## Workflow completion by nux (gt-wisp-8d2)

This demonstrates the full mol-polecat-work molecule lifecycle:
- Load context and verify assignment
- Set up working branch
- Verify tests pass on main
- Implement the solution
- Self-review changes
- Run tests and verify coverage
- Clean up workspace
- Prepare work for review
- Submit to merge queue and exit

## Workflow completion by nux (gt-wisp-0m4)

Demonstrating complete polecat lifecycle:
1. ✓ Primed environment (gt prime, bd prime)
2. ✓ Loaded context and verified assignment
3. ✓ Set up working branch (polecat/nux-mk6ughnd)
4. ✓ Verified tests pass on main
5. → Implementing solution (this file update)
6. → Self-review changes
7. → Run tests and verify coverage
8. → Submit to merge queue via gt done

Polecat contract followed:
- Ephemeral worker model
- Work received via hook
- Progressing through molecule steps
- Will submit to merge queue (not push directly)
- Refinery handles merge after submission
